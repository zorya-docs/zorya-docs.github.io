# Minute 7 - 27/03, 09:00 - IEETA

**Attendees:**  
Carolina, Diogo, Raquel, João, Henrique, Supervisors (Luís Bastião and Carlos Costa)

**Absentees:**  

## Agenda:
1. Poetry – pros and cons
2. Image storage in Dicoogle and database linkage
3. Multiple doctors with the same specialty – how to assign studies?
4. “Actions” page – more details
5. Viewer – current issues and possible help from Prof. Bastião
6. Number of databases – is more than one needed?
7. DICOM images – are SOP IDs unique? Can there be duplicates in Dicoogle?
8. Plugin for Dicoogle – assistance required from Prof. Bastião
9. Improve Dockerfile – consider messaging for help

## Notes:

### 1. **Poetry**
- Poetry will be maintained.
- Provides more benefits than drawbacks.

### 2. **Image Storage in Dicoogle**
- Each image has a unique SOP ID that never repeats.
- Images will be stored in Dicoogle and linked to the database via metadata.

### 3. **Multiple Doctors per Specialty**
- It's possible to have several doctors in the same specialty.
- No need to overcomplicate distribution logic.
- Assign studies based on what each doctor usually handles.
- Prioritize images accordingly in the doctor's worklist.

### 4. **Actions Page**
- Worklist per doctor: shows studies ordered by date.
- Study distribution can come from algorithms.
- Default action: the doctor selects what kind of exam to view (e.g., filtered by type and date).
- **Phase 1**: Manual interaction — doctor selects and annotates.
- **Phase 2**: Default action could run on login.
  - Prof. Carlos Costa flagged this as risky if many users are active.
- Each image should display available algorithms.
- Delay default actions until phase 1 is completed.
- Allow custom/favorite actions for doctors.

### 5. **Databases**
- Multiple databases can exist.
- Different perspectives can be built around the same object.

### 6. **Viewer Implementation**
- Important to implement cropping and other tools.
- Current challenges integrating advanced Cornerstone tools.

### 7. **Manual and Automated Annotations**
- Each doctor should be able to add notes to an image.
- Two annotation layers:
  1. On-image selection/markup.
  2. Free-text notes in a dedicated panel.
- Supports collaborative workflows between doctors.
- Add visual indication if an image has already been analyzed.
- Notes can be useful for validating future model outputs.

### 8. **Dicoogle Plugin**
- Plugin development help likely needed from Prof. Bastião.
- Deferred for now ("not urgent today").

### 9. **Dockerfile**
- Need to improve current Dockerfile setup.
- Might message someone later for guidance.
