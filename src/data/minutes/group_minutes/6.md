**Attendees:**  
Carolina, Diogo, Raquel, João

**Absentees:**  
Henrique

## Agenda:
1. Frontend template setup  
2. API structure  
3. Docker Compose configuration  
4. Evaluation of possible viewers  
5. Task distribution  

## Notes:

### 1. **Frontend Template Setup**
- The base template was initialized in the repository.
- Performed a quick analysis of what should be kept or changed.
- Will use the Figma design as guidance and adapt it to the feedback provided by the supervisors.

### 2. **API Structure**
- The current FastAPI setup follows a modular structure:
  - `backend/` contains all backend code.
  - `backend/app/` includes:
    - `api/` – defines endpoints (e.g., dataset routes),
    - `models/` – defines data models (e.g., dataset entities),
    - `services/` – contains business logic (data manipulation, DB interaction).
  - `main.py` is the entry point that starts FastAPI and includes all route definitions.

### 3. **Docker Compose**
- A working Docker Compose setup is in place including:
  - Frontend
  - Backend
  - MongoDB

### 4. **DICOM Viewers**
- Currently exploring:
  - **Cornerstone**
  - **scrollzoompanw** (for basic interactions)

### 5. **Concrete Task Distribution**

#### **Frontend**
- Key pages to implement:
  - Actions, Admin, Datasets, Models, Algorithms, Sign In
- **Carolina**: Navigation bar and routing between pages.
- **Raquel**: Main datasets page.

#### **API**
- Initial definition of data models is underway.
