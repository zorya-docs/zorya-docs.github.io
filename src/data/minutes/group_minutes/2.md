# Minute 2 - 23/02, 11:30 - Online

**Attendees:** Carolina, Diogo, João, Raquel, Henrique  

**Absentees:**  

## Workflow:  
1. Define logo  
2. Choose project name  
3. Define project slogan  
4. Continue project calendar  
5. Continue website development  
6. Continue presentation PPT - HBMO  

## Notes:  

### 1. Logo:  
- It was decided that we will have a simple logo featuring a microscope.  

### 2. Project Name:  
- Names with “Patho” are interesting, as well as names that are catchy. Since there was no full agreement, we also considered names from mythology (Zorya, Aegle, etc.).  
- As the decision is proving difficult, we will create a poll with multiple options.  

### 3. Slogan Ideas:  
- Something with **“made simple”**? **Shine in the cells**?  

### 4. Project Calendar:  
- Add objectives to all milestones and define the project's main structure.  

### 5. Docs Website:  
- For now, it will remain as is for the presentation. We will make changes based on feedback.  
- Feedback for site improvements:  
  - Change the color of the **minutes page** and implement a **tab (Silver)** to switch between minutes with and without advisors.  
  - **Raquel** is working on the **main page**, which is almost finished.  
  - **Raquel** will also work on the **About Us** page.  
  - **Varela** will design the **footer**, which will include:  
    - Team members with links to their **GitHub profiles**  
    - **GitHub repository** link  
    - **PDF download link** for the project  
- The goal is to **finish the site by today (23/02)** so **Diogo** can deploy it using **GitHub Pages**.  
- **System Information** will be placed under a **“Documentation” tab**, styled similarly to the minutes page.  
- The **main page** should remain simple.  
- Better define the **goals** of our project and include key features.
