### **1. Contextualization and Goals**
The project aims to develop an **information system for digital pathology**, enabling **indexing, searching, and processing of Whole Slide Images (WSI)**. AI-driven workflows will be incorporated to **automatically annotate images**, facilitating medical diagnosis by identifying **cellular necrosis, muscle lesions, and other pathological features**.

### **Main Features:**
- **Characteristics-driven search**: Enables searches based on **organ type, cellular patterns, diagnosis, and specific features** such as mitosis.
- **Sample comparison**: Supports structured **comparative studies between different tissue types and pathologies**.
- **AI-assisted Automated Annotation**: Uses **machine learning models** to categorize and label images.
- **Improved Workflow**: Facilitates **automatic task distribution** among specialists.
- **Normalization with medical ontologies**: Ensures interoperability through **SNOMED CT, ICD-O**, and other standards.
